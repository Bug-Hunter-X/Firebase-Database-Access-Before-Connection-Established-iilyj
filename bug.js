The issue stems from attempting to access a Firebase Realtime Database reference before the database connection is fully established.  This often manifests as `null` or `undefined` values when trying to interact with the database, even if the connection appears successful in other parts of your application.  This is because asynchronous operations inherent to the database connection don't guarantee immediate availability.

```javascript
// Problematic code
firebase.database().ref('users').once('value').then(snapshot => {
  console.log(snapshot.val()); // May be null if database connection not ready
});
```
